# React-Game-Jam-2023-Alien-Invaders-Build
This is a simple game based on the classic Space Invaders made for the React 2023 Game Jam.
Although I am not likely to work in game development, I thought this was an interesting way to practice my JS and React skills, and I also learned a little bit about two new libraries while working on this project, React Pixi and React Redux.
The game itself is not extremely polished in terms of actual gameplay since I know nothing about game design, but I think it was a neat little project that demonstrates some degree of technical skill, and a passion for coding.
Feel free to download and open the index.html to run it!
