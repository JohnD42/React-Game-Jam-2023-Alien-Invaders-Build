# React-Game-Jam-2023-Alien-Invaders-Build
This is a simple game based on the classic Space Invaders made for the React 2023 Game Jam.
Although I am not likely to work in game development, I thought this was an interesting way to practice my JS and React skills, and I also learned a little bit about two new libraries while working on this project, React Pixi and React Redux.
The game itself is not extremely polished in terms of actual gameplay since I know nothing about game design, but I think it was a neat little project that demonstrates some degree of technical skill, and a passion for coding.

The game features aliens which slowly, smoothly descend from the top of the screen, and which will reduce the player's lives by shooting lasers at them, or by reaching the bottom of the screen.
Between rounds, a shop menu is shown, where the player can shoot menu options shown as aliens to purchase upgrades with currency obtained by shooting enemies.
These upgrades can be simple things, such as increasing the player's attack speed, or more complex things, such as buying additional turrets which the player does not control, but which fire automatically at the enemies.
After each round, the game speeds up, and with time, even the number of waves of aliens increases algorithmically.
The game has no end aside from the player losing.

The game also comes complete with music and sound effects from Eric Matyas at www.soundimage.org, and used art assets obtained from Clear_code at opengameart.org/clearcode.
